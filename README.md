# Fetch Receipt Processor
Containarized Go API for handling customer purchase reciepts.
## Installation

### Requirements
- Clone of the repository
- Docker

### Setting Up

1. Clone the repository.
2. Execute `docker build . -t go-containerized:latest` (can provide any name inplace of go-containerized ).
3. Execute `docker run -e PORT=9000 -p 9000:8080 go-containerized:latest` (can provide any port number inplace of 9000 ).

The API is up and running. 
### Testing
The program runs programmed test cases while building during setup. But you can manually test by using following:
1. Execute in a seperate terminal in same folder `curl localhost:9000/receipts/process --include --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d @test/test1.json --request "POST"` (Will return an ID for test1.json ).
2. Execute `curl localhost:9000/receipts/process --include --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d @test/test2.json --request "POST"` (Will return an ID for test2.json ).
3. Execute `curl localhost:9000/receipts/__ID__/points` ( Replace `__ID__` by ID you recieved from either of the eariler POST request  ). Using ID for test1 should return 28 and ID for test2 should return 109.

You can send any other POST and GET requests on `localhost:9000/receipts/process` and `localhost:9000/receipts/__ID__/points` respectively.

## Summary of API Specification

### Endpoint: Process Receipts

* Path: `/receipts/process`
* Method: `POST`
* Payload: Receipt JSON
* Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt.

Description:

Takes in a JSON receipt (see example in the example directory) and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into `/receipts/{id}/points` to get the number of points the receipt
was awarded.

How many points should be earned are defined by the rules below.

Reminder: Data does not need to survive an application restart. This is to allow you to use in-memory solutions to track any data generated by this endpoint.

Example Response:
```json
{ "id": "7fb1377b-b223-49d9-a31a-5a02701dd310" }
```

## Endpoint: Get Points

* Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
* Method: `GET`
* Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

Example Response:
```json
{ "points": 32 }
```

# Rules

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.

* One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
* 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.
